# Day_Planner

Functional, deployed application.

GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.

I was unable to get the "save to local storage" function to work without completely breaking the page. I had a lot of help from my tutor and I went to a couple study groups that were really helpful as well. I wouldn't have gotten as far as I did if it wasn't for Brandon Fall's help. He explained formatting and if/else statments in such a way that I could actually understand.
